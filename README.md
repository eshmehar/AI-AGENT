# AI-AGENT
Built an AI agent that takes a query, searches via Tavily, extracts text from HTML/PDFs using Trafilatura/PyPDF2, summarizes via Groq’s Llama 3.1, saves to SQLite, and displays via Flask UI. Fully local, no credit card needed. Chains search → extract → summarize → store → display. Clean, modular, production-style code. Handles errors gracefully.
